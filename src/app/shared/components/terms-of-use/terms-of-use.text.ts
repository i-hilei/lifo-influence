<h1>
    <u>Will these Terms ever change?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need
    to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms
    at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at
    https://www.lifo.ai/, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other
    means.
</p>
<p>
    If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
    unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.
    If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is
    effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
</p>
<p>
    Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
    modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed
    by both you and us.

    <u>What about my privacy?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    Lifo takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Lifo
    Privacy Policy, please click <a href="https://www.lifo.ai/privacy-policy">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</u></em>
</p>
<p>
    The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”)
    requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they
    knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children
    who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit
    personally identifiable information from children under 16 years of age; if
    you are a child under 16 years of age, please do not attempt to register
    for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If
    we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 16 years
    of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
    believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided us personal
    information, please contact us at info@lifo.ai.
</p>
<h1>
    <u>What are the basics of using Lifo?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and user
    name (“<strong>Lifo User ID</strong>”), and provide us with certain
    information or data, such as your contact information. You promise to
    provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information
    about yourself. You may not select as your Lifo User ID a name that you do
    not have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to
    impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else
    without our prior written permission.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or features of the
    Services by using your account credentials from other services (each, a “ <strong>Third Party Account</strong>”),
    such as those offered by Google,
    Facebook and/or Instagram. By using the Services through a Third Party
    Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for
    use by the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information
    is accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your privacy
    settings on your Third Party Account.
</p>
<p>
    You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a
    binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s
    permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to
    agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on
    behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
    authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization’s or entity’s
    behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you”
    and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that
    organization or entity).
</p>
<p>
    You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not
    on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party. You will comply with
    all laws that apply to you, your use of the Services, and your actions and
    omissions that relate to the Services (for example, Influencers must comply
    with all laws that relate to the Influencer Services (as defined below)).
    If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you
    aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible
    for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
</p>
<p>
    You will not share your Lifo User ID, account or password with anyone, and
    you must protect the security of your Lifo User ID, account, password and
    any other access tools or credentials. You’re responsible for any activity
    associated with your Lifo User ID and account.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Connecting Influencers and Brands</u></em>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Lifo connects individuals providing influencer marketing and advertising
    services (“<strong>Influencers</strong>”) and entities looking to acquire
    their services (“<strong>Brands</strong>”), allowing the Influencers and
    Brands to collaborate and establish individual campaigns to promote and
    market such Brands (each, individually, a “<strong>Campaign</strong>”).
    When we use the word “you” in these Terms, it refers to any user,
    regardless of whether he or she is a Influencer, Brand or otherwise, while
    if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of
    user.
</p>
<p>
    Lifo uses reasonable efforts to vet each potential Influencer, including
    checking each Influencer's background, experience, publicly available
    information, and relevant certifications, before recommending a certain
    Influencer to Brands. However, before receiving services from any
    Influencer (“<strong>Influencer Services</strong>”), Brands are responsible
    for making their own determinations that the recommended Influencer is
    suitable for the Brand’s purposes. Lifo is only responsible for connecting
    Influencers and Brands, and can’t and won’t be responsible for making sure
    that Campaigns are successful (economically or otherwise) or that
    Influencer Services are actually provided or are up to a certain standard
    of quality. Lifo similarly can’t and won’t be responsible for ensuring that
    information (including credentials) a Brand or Influencer provides about
    himself or herself is accurate or up-to-date. We don’t control the actions
    of any Brand or Influencer, and neither Influencers nor Brands are our
    employees.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        INFLUENCERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OF BRANDS AND NOT EMPLOYEES,
        PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, INDEPENDENT
        CONTRACTORS OR FRANCHISEES OF LIFO. LIFO DOES NOT OFFER THE INFLUENCER
        SERVICES AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM THE INFLUENCER
        SERVICES. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LIFO DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT,
        CONTROL OR MONITOR THE INFLUENCER SERVICES AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
        RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE INFLUENCER SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE
        SERVICES, WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Brands and Influencers must not attempt to circumvent the Lifo payment
        system by soliciting payment between each other outside of the Services
        (“Outside Payments”). If you are the offeror, payor or recipient, of
        any Outside Payments we may terminate your Lifo account, and you
        acknowledge that Lifo is not responsible for collecting or enforcing
        any Outside Payments. You agree to notify Lifo immediately if you
        become aware of any such offer or solicitation for Outside Payments. If
        Lifo provides you an agreement, this is for template purposes only. We
        are not lawyers and do not provide legal advice, you should seek legal
        opinion from counsel for review of any such agreement and regarding any
        questions.

<p>
    (j) decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the

    photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (as defined below) and so

    by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide

</p>
<p>
    Subject to these Terms, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide,
    non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e.,
    to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the
    Services. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any

    the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this
    Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the

<p>
    <em><u>User Submissions</u></em>
</p>
<p>
    Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the
    Services is your “<strong>User Submission</strong>”. Some User Submissions
    may be viewable by other users. You are solely responsible for all User
    Submissions you contribute to the Services. You represent that all User
    Submissions submitted by you are accurate, complete, up-to-date, and in
    compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
</p>
<p>
    You agree that you will not post, upload, share, store, or otherwise
    provide through the Services any User Submissions that: (i) infringe any
    third party's copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights,
    etc.); (ii) contain sexually explicit content or pornography; (iii) contain
    hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incite hatred against any

</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Licenses</u></em>
</p>
<p>
    In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow
    other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights
    in those User Submissions (see below for more information). Please note
    that all of the following licenses are subject to our <a href="https://www.lifo.ai/privacy-policy">Privacy
    Policy</a> to the
    extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your
    personally-identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
    For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Lifo a license to translate,
    modify (for technical purposes, for example, making sure your content is
    viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer) and reproduce and
    otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable
    us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a
    license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
</p>
<p>
    If you store a User Submission in your own personal Lifo account, in a
    manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “ <strong>Personal User Submission</strong>”), you
    grant
    Lifo the license
    above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your
    Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User
    Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.
</p>
<p>
    If you share a User Submission in a manner that only certain specified
    users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users)
    (a “<strong>Limited Audience User Submission</strong>”), then you grant
    Lifo the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and
    distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of
    making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other
    specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you
    grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience
    User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by
    the functionality of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner
    that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you
    provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions,
    improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the
    Services (each of the foregoing, a “<strong>Public User Submission</strong>
    ”), then you grant Lifo the licenses above, as well as a license to
    display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the
    purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Lifo users
    and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights
    necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in
    connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with Lifo’s
    business. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to
    access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in
    it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
    sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete
    your Lifo account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions (other
    than Public User Submissions, which may remain fully available) to other
    users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be
    possible to completely delete that content from Lifo’s records, and that
    your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they
    were copied or stored by other users.
</p>
<p>
    Certain features of the Services allow you to share information with
    others, including through your social networks or other Third Party
    Accounts. When Content is authorized for sharing, we will clearly identify
    the Content you are authorized to redistribute and the ways you may
    redistribute it, usually by providing a “share” button on or near the
    Content. If you share information from the Services with others through
    your Third Party Accounts, such as your social networks, you authorize Lifo
    to share that information with the applicable Third Party Account provider.
    Please review the policies of any Third Party Account providers you share
    information with or through for additional information about how they may
    use your information. If you redistribute Content, you must be able to edit
    or delete any Content you redistribute, and you must edit or delete it
    promptly upon our request.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, you understand and agree that Lifo, in performing the required
    technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may
    need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those
    User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks,
    devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights
    to do so.

    <u>Will Lifo ever change the Services?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time.
    We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce
    new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to
    parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a
    material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this
    isn’t always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the
    Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if
    someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms),
    in our sole discretion, and without notice.
</p>
<h1>
    <u>Do the Services cost anything?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services.
    <strong>
        If we charge you for the Services, you may not attempt to circumvent
        the Lifo payment system by soliciting payment from a user (Brand,
        Influencer or otherwise) outside of the Services. You agree to notify
        Lifo immediately if you receive any such offer or solicitation
    </strong>
    . Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services,
    data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs
    are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier
    to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of
    the Services.
</p>
<p>
    a. <u>Paid Services</u>. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments
    now or in the future (the “<strong>Paid Services</strong>”). For the Paid
    Services, Lifo collects payment from Brand(s) for each individual Campaign
    at varying rates based upon the parameters for the Campaign set by such
    Brand(s). Lifo will pay Influencer(s) a commission of the Net Revenue
    collected from such Brand(s) upon the Influencer(s)’ successful completion
    of task(s) for such Campaign (the commission paid to such Influencer(s)
    will be calculated on a Campaign by Campaign basis according to the
    parameters set by the Brand and the amount of Net Revenue collected by
    Lifo). “<strong>Net Revenue</strong>” shall mean amounts actually received
    by Lifo from Brands for payment to an individual Influencer who has agreed
    to participate in a certain Campaign, less (i) sales taxes, use taxes,
    withholding taxes, VAT and any other taxes, duties or other government
    tariffs that a governmental authority requires Lifo or the Brand to pay
    with respect to the subject matter hereunder; and (ii) any transaction
    fees, disputes and refunds. Additionally, some Paid Services will charge a
    fee for downloading or installing the Services through the App Store (as
    defined below) linked to your specific device. You agree to comply with,
    and your license to use our mobile application is conditioned upon your
    compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. Any refunds relating
    to the applications or inquiries regarding refunds relating to the
    applications shall be handled solely by the applicable App Store in
    accordance with such App Store’s terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>
    b. <u>Billing</u>. We use a third-party payment processor (the “ <strong>Payment Processor</strong>”) to bill
    you
    through a payment account
    linked to your account on the Services (your “ <strong>Billing Account</strong>”) for use of the Paid Services.
    The
    processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy
    policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, we
    use Shopify Inc.’s integration with Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor.
    You can access Shopify’s Terms of Service at
    <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">
        https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms
    </a>
    and their Privacy Policy at
    <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy">

    <a href="https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal">

    </a>
    and their Privacy Policy at <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.
    We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the
    Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us,
    through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for
    any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment
    terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your
    chosen payment provider (your “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”). You agree
    to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to
    correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it
    has already requested or received payment.
</p>
<p>
    c. <u>Payment Method</u>. The terms of your payment will be based on your
    Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the
    financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen
    Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive
    payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account
    upon demand.
</p>
<p>
    d. <u>Current Information Required</u>. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE
    AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE
    ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE
    (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD
    EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR
    IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU
    BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED
    DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH
    INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF
    THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR
    ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE
    TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
</p>
<p>
    e. <u>Change in Amount Authorized</u>. If the amount to be charged to your
    Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to
    the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the
    right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged
    and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.
    Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of
    your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and
    submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each
    billing cycle.
</p>
<p>
    f. <u>Free Trials and Other Promotions</u>. Any free trial or other
    promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the
    specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the
    end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid
    Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are
    inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at
    info@lifo.ai.
</p>
<h1>
    <u>What if I want to stop using the Services?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at info@lifo.ai; please
    refer to our <a href="https://www.lifo.ai/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, as well as
    the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to
    us after you have stopped using our Services.
</p>
<p>
    Lifo is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the
    Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your
    breach of these Terms. Lifo has the sole right to decide whether you are in
    violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms; for example,
    a Brand who believes that a Influencer may be in breach of these Terms is
    not able to enforce these Terms against that Influencer.
</p>
<p>
    Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated
    with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your
    account.
</p>
<p>
    If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at
    info@lifo.ai – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise
    that we can recover or restore anything.
</p>
<p>
    Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms
    shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will
    survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any
    limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual
    property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without
    limitation the arbitration agreement.

    <u>What about Mobile Applications and In-App Purchases?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application
    is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the
    application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from
    Google (each an “<strong>App Store</strong>”). Each App Store may have its
    own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile
    applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to
    Apple App Store set forth below. You agree to comply with, and your license
    to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App
    Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions
    from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with,
    the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, the more restrictive or
    conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Use apply.
</p>
<p>
    Through our mobile applications, you may purchase (“ <strong>In-App Purchase</strong>”) certain goods or
    features
    designed to
    enhance the performance of the Services. When you make an In-App Purchase,
    you are doing so through either the Apple iTunes service or the Google Play
    service and you are agreeing to their respective Terms and Conditions,
    available at
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html">

    the Services;
</p>
<p>
    (c) You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device
    that you own or control;
</p>
<p>
    (d) You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to

</p>
<p>
    (e) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any
    applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple

    Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
    discharge of any such infringement claim;
</p>
<p>
    (h) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject

    (j) Both you and Lifo acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s

    <u>Can I refer other users?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    From time to time Lifo may offer rewards or incentives for referring others
    to the Services. For details of any current referral offers, please see our
    website and/or Application. The referring user (“<strong>Referrer</strong>
    ”) may refer individuals or entities who are neither current customers of
    Lifo nor registered users of the Services (“<strong>Referee</strong>”). A
    registered user is a person or entity that already has an existing account
    with Lifo. There is no limit to the number of referrals that Referrer can
    make, nor the cumulative rewards or incentives that the Referrer may
    receive through such special offer, unless otherwise indicated. Referrer
    will receive the stated reward or incentive for each Referee sent by the
    Referrer that completes the required action described in that specific
    offer (such as signing up for an account or making a purchase). All
    Referees must be first-time recipients of the offer, and multiple referrals
    to the same individual or entity will be disregarded. Lifo reserves the
    right to modify or terminate any special offers at any time and to revoke
    from Referrer and Referee the special offer at Lifo's discretion for any
    reason or for no reason whatsoever. If Lifo determines that Referrer or
    Referee is attempting to obtain unfair advantage or otherwise violate the
    terms or spirit of such special offer, Lifo reserves the right to (a)
    revoke any rewards or incentives issued to either Referrer or Referee
    and/or (b) charge the Referrer or Referee for any rewards or incentives (1)
    used by Referrer or Referee prior to such revocation or (2) issued by Lifo
    to any ineligible Referrer or Referee. All special offers are subject to
    any other terms, conditions and restrictions set forth on the Services or
    presented in connection with the special offer.

    question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter
    of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a

    English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules
    and Procedures (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”) then in effect, by one
    commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual
    property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected
    from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such
    Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered
    in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    (b) <em>Costs of Arbitration</em>. The Rules will govern payment of all
    arbitration fees. Lifo will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than
    seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Lifo will not seek its attorneys’
    fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your
    claim is frivolous.
</p>
<p>
    (c) <em>Small Claims Court; Infringement</em>. Either you or Lifo may
    assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Jose,
    California or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore,
    notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party
    shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any
    time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or
    threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's
    copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual
    property rights.
</p>
<p>
    (d) <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>. <strong>YOU AND </strong> <strong>LIFO</strong>
    <strong>
        WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
        TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY
    </strong>
    . You and Lifo are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by
    arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
    efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject
    to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Lifo
    over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award,<strong>YOU AND </strong><strong>LIFO</strong> <strong>
    WAIVE
    ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>, and elect instead to
    have the dispute be resolved by a judge.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    (e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>.
    <strong>
        ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
        MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A
        CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE
        ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER
        CUSTOMER OR USER
    </strong>
    . If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed
    invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Lifo is entitled to arbitration;
    instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in
    (g) below.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    (f) <em>Opt-out</em>. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of
    this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the
    following address: 35640 Fremont Boulevard, #607, Fremont, CA, 94536
    postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must
    include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or
    telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement
    that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.
</p>
<p>
    (g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or
    in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits
    either you or Lifo to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to
    the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration
    agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Lifo agree that
    any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought
    in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Jose,
    California, or the federal district in which that county falls.
</p>
<p>
    (h) <em>Severability</em>. If the prohibition against class actions and
    other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to
    be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration
    Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will
    survive the termination of your relationship with Lifo.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Miscellaneous</u></em>
    . You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting
    all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your
    activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Lifo may, in
    its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself
    as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way,
    any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
    hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or
    invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum
    extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force
    and effect and enforceable. You and Lifo agree that these Terms are the
    complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you
    and Lifo, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written
    and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to
    the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that
    you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Lifo, and you
    do not have any authority of any kind to bind Lifo in any respect
    whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
    Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple
    Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Lifo agree there are no
    third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
